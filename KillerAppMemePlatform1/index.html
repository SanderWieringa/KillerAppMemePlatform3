  <h1>Your website is working</h1>
  <p>Have just setup your domain.</p>
  <p>Replace this file with your own website by uploading an new website via FTP (venus.fhict.nl) and login with your FHICT account.<br/>
If you connect to FTP you will see a readme.txt file and a folder called domains, with one or more domains. If you remove these folders, your website will no longer function correctly!
  </p>
  <p>Your website is (by default) available over http and https, but you can force (or redirect) https. This only applies for subdomains of venus.fhict.nl</p>
